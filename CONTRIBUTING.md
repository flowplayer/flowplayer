## Committing code

We prefer

- [Pull Requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.
- Bug fixes and features that originate from an [issue](https://github.com/flowplayer/flowplayer/issues/)
- Commits that are [tagged](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation) with issues
- Smaller commits rather than large ones

All pull requests should be done against the `dev` branch!

Never do commits to the `master` branch!
